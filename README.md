My code gerate much notes with frequency and time (C4, 1 sec).

### EValuation:

We create a evaluation for this notes as: This note is a note of Scale? This note is on my chords? 

*Example:*

- Good Sound
Chords:  C             F            G
Melody:  C - E  -  E - F - G  - A - B - G

- Bad Sound (G is not a note of F Chord)
Chords:  C             F            G
Melody:  C - E  -  E - G - F  - A - B - G
